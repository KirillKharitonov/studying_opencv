# Mastering OpenCV
Here would be my try to study an  opencv library.
I'm reading [a book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-opencv-4-computer-vision-with-python-3-third-edition/9781789531619)
and trying to make excercises.

## Chapter 2. Handling Files, Cameras and GUIs.
By passing this chapter i've understood how to read, write images in cases when they are presented as files and video frames.
After reading this chapter i've done first part of Cameo project, which helps to understand how to interact with web camera.

## Chapter 3. Processing images with OpenCV.
In this chapter we started to explore the Fourier transform.
The first example was about HPF and LPF -> i tested edge detection: observed required kernels to make edge detection possible.
Then i studied what is Laplacian operator: it perfoms the second derivative of an image.
